  storyText: 'You check your phone, still in bed. You go to your social media. Zero
    notifications, as usual. You only have one follower and you don''t even know
    who it is. One post catches your eye. There''s been a murder in your city. There
    is a picture of the main square and some police officers. You go through this
    square every day to get to the office. A 12 years old boy has been found dead
    in the fountain, stabbed in the neck.


    You get out of bed and get ready
    to go to work. You cook yourself bacon and eggs, and prepare some coffee, like
    you''ve been doing for a long time.'
